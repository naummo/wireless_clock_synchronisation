wireless_clock_synchronisation
==============================

This is a source code produced by Naums Mogers in November-December 2014 for the open assessment of the 'Embedded Systems Design and Implementation' module at the University of York.
Assessment consists of three tasks. All tasks require that 4 to 10 wireless real or simulated devices synchronize their internal clocks via radio within 60 seconds. Each task utilizes separate synchronization method or implementation platform.
Task 1: baselineSync.java
Task 2: SimpleSync.java
Task 3: fireflySync.java

Refer to the PDF documentation for more information on the implementation: https://www.dropbox.com/s/ceotfoe9pglmomq/Task_documentation.pdf?dl=0
